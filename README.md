# Forex LSTM Signals (Automated)

This project provides an automated pipeline for Forex signal generation using MetaTrader 5 data, LSTM model training, and a real-time FastAPI monitoring dashboard.

## Architecture Overview

The system is now composed of two main parts designed for automated, continuous operation:

1.  **Scheduler (`scheduler.py`)**: A command-line script that runs the entire data pipeline in sequence: data fetching, dataset creation, model training, and signal inference. It's designed to be run automatically by a system scheduler (like Windows Task Scheduler or cron).

2.  **Web Dashboard (`scripts/web_server.py`)**: A FastAPI application that provides a real-time view of the system's outputs. It features:
    *   A dashboard to display the latest trading signals generated by the pipeline.
    *   A real-time price feed for all configured currency pairs.
    *   An API to access this data programmatically.

## Windows Deployment

For detailed instructions on how to set up the environment and configure the automated execution on a Windows Server, please refer to **[DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md)**.

### Quick Steps:

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2.  **Run the pipeline manually (for testing):**
    ```bash
    codex run pipeline
    ```
3.  **Start the web dashboard:**
    ```bash
    codex run web
    ```
4.  Open http://127.0.0.1:8000 to view the dashboard.

## Available API Endpoints

The web server provides the following endpoints:

- `GET /`: The main HTML dashboard.
- `GET /api/signals`: Returns the latest trading signals from `outputs/signals.json`.
- `GET /api/prices`: Returns real-time bid/ask prices for all configured symbols.

## Project Layout

- `config.yaml`: Main configuration for symbols, timeframes, and model parameters.
- `scheduler.py`: The main pipeline execution script for automated runs.
- `scripts/`: Directory containing the individual pipeline scripts (`fetch_mt5.py`, `train_lstm.py`, etc.) and the `web_server.py`.
- `DEPLOY.md`: Detailed instructions for server deployment and automation.
- `data/`, `models/`, `outputs/`: Runtime artifacts created by the pipeline.
- `codex.yaml`: Shortcuts for running the pipeline and web server.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
